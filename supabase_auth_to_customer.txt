after sucesful login auth.users data stored
so moving users to customer became essential

so created a trigger function in sql

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth_to_customer()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public."Customer" (
    id,
    email,
    "createdAt",
    "updatedAt"
  )
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    NOW(),
    NOW()
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

this can also done by manually by going into db functions and triggers
then created trigger for user creation for customerDROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION auth_to_customer();  -- this uses public schema by default


also check by adding into auth.users
INSERT INTO auth.users (id, email) 
VALUES ('f47ac10d-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479', 'dummy4@example.com');

and for updatedAt 
ALTER TABLE "Customer"
ALTER COLUMN "updatedAt" SET DEFAULT now();
